__Please note that the RJ45 connector I used is 11.5mm tall.__ For the controller cover to fit, you will need that same low profile RJ45 connector.

*You can find heat set insert kits that have multiple sizes, like these. You will need a tool to install them.

# CRITICAL ASSEMBLY NOTES:
The controller cover is specifically designed for the shorter RJ45 connector that is 11.5mm tall, check the height before assembly.

It also requires short headers equal to the ones in the Adafruit short headers kit for their Feather board.

You will need to put the controller cover in place before attaching the populated switchplate to the PCB. The cover does not have a fastener to lock it in place, just the switchplate.
Check that the USB-C connector is seated in the cutout.
